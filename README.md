    - basic user profile, can be updated
- films
    - basic film profile. 
- media
    - i have no idea what it does.

what is working:
- users
    - login and registration system
- films 
    - review and essay system.
        - reviews and essays can be added under films
        - comments can be added under essays
        - reviews and essays can be edited or deleted by the author.

what needs to be done:
- films
    - the Film class is a placeholder and should be updated. the reviews, essays and comments only need the film id, so it will work as long as theres a Film class.
    - templates look terrible, should be changed to something better looking
    - needs a function that lets users add films. currently films can only be added through the admin page, while reviews, essays and comments can be added by users that are logged in. also maybe add deleting and editing comments?
